## üìò Project Overview

Accurate forecasting of electricity demand is essential for **grid stability, renewable integration, and sustainable energy planning**.  
This project develops **short-term load forecasting models** for **England and Wales (2024)** using **half-hourly electricity demand data** from the **National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO)** and **Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service (BMRS)**.

By combining traditional time-series models (ARIMA) with advanced **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and Hybrid CNN-LSTM models), the project aims to enhance forecasting accuracy and support smarter energy management.

## üéØ Aim

To develop a **robust and accurate short-term electricity demand forecasting model** that captures temporal patterns, renewable contributions, and interconnector dynamics for **England and Wales (2024)**.

---

## üß© Objectives

- Collect and clean high-resolution half-hourly demand data (2024).  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify daily, weekly, and seasonal trends.  
- Engineer features such as lag values, rolling averages, holidays, and renewable generation.  
- Evaluate and compare multiple forecasting models: **ARIMA**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **LSTM**.  
- Assess model performance using **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **MAPE**.  
- Use **SHAP values** to interpret model explainability and feature importance.

## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   Verified timestamps, handled missing data, converted formats.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Line plots, boxplots, and heatmaps to detect seasonal patterns.  
   - Correlation analysis between demand, temperature, renewables, and flows.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Lagged demand values (t‚àí1, t‚àí24, t‚àí48).  
   - Rolling averages (3h, 6h, 12h).  
   - Holiday indicators and cyclical time encodings (sine/cosine).

4. **Model Development:**  
   - Baseline: **ARIMA**  
   - Tree-based: **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**  
   - Deep Learning: **LSTM**, **Hybrid CNN‚ÄìLSTM with Attention**

5. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   RMSE, MAE, and MAPE were used to compare accuracy.

6. **Explainability:**  
   Used **SHAP** (SHapley Additive Explanations) to interpret the influence of each feature.

## üöÄ Results Summary

| Model | RMSE (MW) | MAPE (%) | Key Observation |
|--------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| ARIMA | 3,200 | 7.8 | Captures daily cycles only |
| Random Forest | 2,050 | 4.9 | Handles nonlinearities well |
| XGBoost | 1,780 | 4.1 | Excellent gradient boosting accuracy |
| **LSTM** | **1,540** | **3.6** | Best overall performance |

**Best Model:** LSTM ‚Äî 50% lower RMSE than ARIMA.  
It accurately captured complex nonlinear and temporal dependencies.

## üîç Key Findings

- Clear **daily and weekly demand cycles** with peaks around **07:00‚Äì09:00** and **18:00‚Äì21:00**.  
- **Temperature** strongly influenced demand (r = ‚àí0.72).  
- **Holiday effects** reduced demand by up to **20%** on working days.  
- **LSTM** was most effective for short-term load forecasting.  
- **Feature importance  :** Temperature, Day of Week, Holiday Flag, Lag Demand, and Wind/Solar Generation.
